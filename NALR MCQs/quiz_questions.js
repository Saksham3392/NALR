 * 🤖 AI AGENT QUESTION INTEGRATION PROTOCOL:
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * When adding new questions to this file (e.g., from lecture slides / PDFs):
 * 
 * 1. EXACT QUESTION OBJECT SCHEMA:
 *    Every question object inside the QUIZ_QUESTIONS array MUST strictly follow:
 *    {
 *      "id": "modX_qY",        // [Required] Unique ID with module prefix (e.g. 'ages_q1', 'allg_q1')
 *      "module_id": "modX",    // [Required] Module identifier (e.g. 'mod10', 'mod12', 'mod13')
 *      "module_name": "...",   // [Required] Module Title matching syllabus.js (e.g. 'Ages')
 *      "syllabus_lec": "...",  // [Required] Subtitle/lecture tag from syllabus.js
 *      "type_id": "type_Z",    // [Required] Subtab Type ID matching syllabus.js (e.g. 'type_1')
 *      "type_name": "...",     // [Required] Exact subtab display name from syllabus.js
 *      "difficulty": "Medium", // [Required] 'Easy' | 'Medium' | 'Hard'
 *      "points": 1,            // [Required] Typically 1
 *      "question": "...",      // [Required] Formatted question prompt text (markdown/KaTeX supported)
 *      "options": [ ... ],     // [Required] Array of string options (usually 4 or 5 choices)
 *      "correct": "...",       // [CRITICAL] MUST be an EXACT character-for-character match to one option!
 *      "explanation": "..."    // [Required] Step-by-step mathematical or logical solution breakdown
 *    }
 * 
 * 2. THE 5 GOLDEN RULES FOR AI AGENTS:
 *    Rule 1: VERBATIM CORRECT ANSWER:
 *            `q.options.includes(q.correct)` MUST be strictly true. Never put an answer
 *            in `correct` that is not verbatim present inside `options`.
 *    Rule 2: SYLLABUS SYNCHRONIZATION:
 *            `module_id` and `type_id` MUST correspond to an existing type in `syllabus.js`.
 *            Make sure the subtab's `count` in `syllabus.js` matches the question count.
 *    Rule 3: UNIQUE IDS:
 *            Use descriptive unique ID prefixes (e.g. `br_q1`, `part_q1`, `syl_q1`, `ages_q1`).
 *    Rule 4: EXAM SELECTION:
 *            When activating a new module, add its `module_id` to `selectedExamModuleIds`
 *            in `app.js` so it is included in Exam Mode by default.
 *    Rule 5: AUTOMATED VERIFICATION:
 *            Always run `python verify_dataset.py` after editing to verify:
 *            - 0 duplicate IDs
 *            - 0 missing options or explanations
 *            - 0 answer mismatches
 *            - 100% sync with syllabus.js
 *
